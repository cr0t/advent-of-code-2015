# Advent of Code 2015

Solutions written in Elixir as [Livebook](https://livebook.dev/) notebooks.

## Notes

### Day 1: Not Quite Lisp

Part 1 solved with `Enum.reduce/3` with pattern-matching. 2nd part solved with `Enum.reduce_while/3`, pattern-matching, and guards.

### Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math

Part 1 solved with `Enum.reduce/3`, `Enum.min/1`, and simple arithmetics.
